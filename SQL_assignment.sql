#. Q1:  Create a table called employees with the following structure
#ANS:

CREATE DATABASE company;
USE company;


CREATE TABLE employees ( 
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
emp_name TEXT  NOT NULL, 
age INT check (age >= 18), 
email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
salary DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 30000
);


#Q2 : Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide
#     examples of common types of constraints.

-- Purpose of Constraints in a Database

-- Constraints are rules applied to table columns to ensure correctness, consistency, and reliability of the data. They act like guardrails that prevent invalid or inconsistent data from entering the database.

-- By enforcing constraints, databases maintain data integrity ‚Äî meaning the data stays accurate, consistent, and trustworthy over time.

--  How Constraints Help Maintain Data Integrity

-- Prevent invalid data entry
-- Example: If age must be >= 18, a constraint stops you from inserting a value like 15.

-- Avoid duplication
-- Example: A UNIQUE constraint on email ensures no two employees register with the same email.

-- Maintain consistency between tables
-- Example: A FOREIGN KEY ensures an order is linked only to an existing customer.

-- Provide default values
-- Example: If no salary is given, the DEFAULT constraint ensures it gets set to 30,000.


-- Common Types of Constraints with Examples

-- PRIMARY KEY
-- Ensures each row is uniquely identifiable and not NULL.

-- emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY
-- ‚Üí No duplicate IDs, and no null values.

-- NOT NULL
-- Ensures a column must always have a value.

-- emp_name TEXT NOT NULL


-- ‚Üí Prevents saving a record without a name.

-- UNIQUE
-- Ensures all values in a column are distinct.

-- email TEXT UNIQUE


-- ‚Üí No two employees can share the same email.

-- CHECK
-- Restricts values in a column to meet a condition.

-- age INT CHECK (age >= 18)


-- ‚Üí Prevents storing underage employees.

-- DEFAULT
-- Provides a default value if none is supplied.

-- salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 30000


-- ‚Üí If salary is not entered, it defaults to 30,000.

-- FOREIGN KEY
-- Ensures data in one table refers to valid data in another.

-- dept_id INT REFERENCES departments(dept_id)


-- ‚Üí Prevents assigning an employee to a department that doesn‚Äôt exist.


#Q3: Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.

-- Why Apply the NOT NULL Constraint?

-- The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column must always have a value ‚Äî it can never store NULL (missing/unknown) data.

-- ‚úÖ Reasons to use NOT NULL:

-- Essential information ‚Üí Some data is mandatory (e.g., emp_name, date_of_birth).

-- Prevent incomplete records ‚Üí Ensures no empty fields for critical columns.

-- Improve data integrity ‚Üí Guarantees every record has valid and usable information.

-- emp_name TEXT NOT NULL
-- This ensures that every employee must have a name in the database.

-- üîπ Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?
-- No. A primary key cannot contain NULL values.

-- ‚úÖ Justification:
-- Uniqueness requirement ‚Üí A primary key uniquely identifies each row.

-- If NULL were allowed, multiple rows could have NULL, which breaks uniqueness (because NULL means "unknown," and two unknowns cannot be guaranteed as different).

-- Identification ‚Üí Primary keys are meant to uniquely identify each record. A NULL value would mean the record has no identifier, defeating the purpose.

-- üìå Example:

-- sql
-- Copy code
-- emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY
-- Every employee must have a unique ID.

-- NULL is not allowed because then the employee wouldn‚Äôt be identifiable.

-- ‚úÖ Summary:

-- Use NOT NULL to ensure critical columns always have a value.

-- A primary key cannot contain NULLs because it must uniquely and reliably identify each row in the table.


# Q4:  Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint.

-- ANS: 

-- Add a Constraint

-- Use ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT.

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);

-- Remove a Constraint

-- Use ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT.

ALTER TABLE employees
DROP CONSTRAINT unique_email;


# Q5 :   Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints. Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.

-- ANS: 
-- Constraint Violations & Consequences

-- NOT NULL ‚Üí Inserting NULL ‚Üí ‚ùå Row rejected.
-- Error: ERROR: null value in column "emp_name" violates not-null constraint

-- PRIMARY KEY ‚Üí Duplicate/NULL key ‚Üí ‚ùå Row rejected.
-- Error: ERROR: duplicate key value violates primary key constraint "employees_pkey"

-- UNIQUE ‚Üí Duplicate value ‚Üí ‚ùå Row rejected.
-- Error: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "unique_email"

-- CHECK ‚Üí Condition fails (e.g., age < 18) ‚Üí ‚ùå Row rejected.
-- Error: ERROR: new row violates check constraint "check_age"

-- FOREIGN KEY ‚Üí Missing parent record or restricted delete ‚Üí ‚ùå Action blocked.
-- Error: ERROR: insert or update violates foreign key constraint "fk_dept"

#Q6: You created a products table without constraints as follows:

CREATE TABLE products (

    product_id INT,

    product_name VARCHAR(50),

    price 	 DECIMAL(10, 2));
    
    
-- Now, you realise that?
-- : The product_id should be a primary keyQ
-- : The price should have a default value of 50.00


-- ANS:

ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_product_id PRIMARY KEY (product_id) ; 

ALTER TABLE products
ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 50.00;

Drop table classes;

# Q7: You have two tables:

CREATE TABLE classes ( 
class_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
class_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE students ( 
student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
student_name VARCHAR(100),
class_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES Classes(class_id)
);

INSERT INTO Classes (class_id, class_name)
VALUES
(101, 'Math'),
(102, 'Science'),
(103, 'History');

INSERT INTO students (student_id, student_name, class_id) VALUES 
(1, "Alice", 101),
(2, "Bob", 102),
(3, "Charlie", 101);


SELECT 
    Students.student_name,
    Classes.class_name
FROM 
    Students
INNER JOIN 
    Classes ON Students.class_id = Classes.class_id;
    
    
#Q8 : Consider the following three tables:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,

(101, 'Alice'),
(102, 'Bob');

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

INSERT INTO Orders (order_id, order_date, customer_id) VALUES
(1, '2024-01-01', 101),
(2, '2024-01-03', 102);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    order_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id)

INSERT INTO Products (product_id, product_name, order_id) VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 1),
(2, 'Phone', NULL);
